<h1>Electronics</h1>
<p>The study of electornics is extremely diverse and requires solid mathematical knowledge, understanding of physics and it overlaps with software engineering as well.</p>
<p>I focus on the fields of discrete logic, microcontrollers, long an medium wave radio and power regulation.</p>
<p>I am a software engineer by training, but I did study basics of microelectornics and I studied the rest on my own. I always complement the study of theory by practical experiments and I have built all the projects I am sharing on this site.</p>
<h1>Literature</h1>
<p>This is my recomended reading list for all who would like to learn about electronics.</p>
