# Electronics

The study of electronics is extremely diverse and requires solid mathematical knowledge, understanding of physics and it overlaps with software engineering as well.

I focus on the fields of discrete logic, micro-controllers, long an medium wave radio and power regulation.

I am a software engineer by training, but I did study basics of micro electronics and I studied the rest on my own. I always complement the study of theory by practical experiments and I have built all the projects I am sharing on this site.

# Literature

This is my recommended reading list for all who would like to learn about electronics.

- Behzad Razavi: [Fundamentals of Microelectronics](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Fundamentals+of+Microelectronics%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781119695141)
    - very rigorous and analytical textbook
    - theoretical exercises
    - limited number of practical circuits
- Albert P Malvino, Jerald A Brown: [Digital Computer Electronics](https://archive.org/details/digital-computer-electronics-albert-paul-malvino-and-jerald-a-brown)
    - step-by-step introduction into electronic logic
    - includes a DIY guide to build a computer from ICs
    - [download](https://dn721602.ca.archive.org/0/items/digital-computer-electronics-albert-paul-malvino-and-jerald-a-brown/Digital-Computer-Electronics-Albert-Paul-Malvino-and-Jerald-A-Brown%29.pdf)
- Horowitz, Hill: [The Art of Electronics](https://artofelectronics.net/)
    - complex overview of the entire field
    - many practical examples

# SW Tools

- LTSpice [`Version:17.2.4`](https://ltspice.analog.com/software/LTspice.pkg) - I use Windows and MacOS versions but Mac more often
- KiCad [`Version: 9.0.3`](https://downloads.kicad.org/kicad/macos/explore/stable/download/kicad-unified-universal-9.0.3.dmg) - Tested on MacOS
- FreCAD [`Version: 0.21.0`](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/0.21.0) - MacOS version is much faster, especially when converting large layouts for 3D printer
- CHITUBOX Basic - Windows and MacOS versions work the same, compatible with [ELEGOO Mars 3 Pro](https://www.elegoo.cz/produkty/resinove-3d-tiskarny/mars-3-pro/) which I use to develop UV sensitive PCB boards
