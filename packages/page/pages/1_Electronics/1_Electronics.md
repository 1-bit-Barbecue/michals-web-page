# Electronics

The study of electornics is extremely diverse and requires solid mathematical knowledge, understanding of physics and it overlaps with software engineering as well.

I focus on the fields of discrete logic, microcontrollers, long an medium wave radio and power regulation.

I am a software engineer by training, but I did study basics of microelectornics and I studied the rest on my own. I always complement the study of theory by practical experiments and I have built all the projects I am sharing on this site.

# Literature

This is my recomended reading list for all who would like to learn about electronics.
