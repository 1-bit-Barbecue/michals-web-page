# Electronic Logic

All kinds of transistors, diodes and vacuum tubes can be used to create electronic switches which can be in turen used to build logic circuits. The logic circuits can be combined to build logic systems based on [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra).

The [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) is defined by binary variables and basic logic operations. Each boolean variable x 

$$
\displaystyle\sum_{k=3}^5 k^2=3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 =50
$$

# Logic Gates

Logic systems are built from logic gates, which represent logic operations of the [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra). It is possible to build gates implementing the basic operations `and`, `or` and `not`, but it is possible to build the entire algebra using a `nand` and `nor` gates. `nand` is a `not and` operation and `nor is `not or`.

# Discrete Logic

Discrete logic was the standard in the 1960s, it gor replaced by integrated logic with the development of manufacturing techniques and expanded from low integration (logic gates in)
